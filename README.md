# Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the stock price of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)** using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting problems, especially where historical patterns and long-term dependencies matter.

The model is implemented using **Python** in **Google Colab** and trained on historical stock price data to predict future closing prices.
